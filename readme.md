Base from [HTML5 image upload, resize and crop](https://www.codeforest.net/html5-image-upload-resize-and-crop), I created some php file to demostrate this tutorial.

The `index.php` file show the basic form, you can choose multiple files to upload. `upload.php` will handle the upload process.

The `drag-drop.php` show drag & drop file to upload example.

The `image-preview.php` show preview image before upload example. It also can upload by post to `upload.php`.

The `h5upload-form.php` show example of uploading file by html5 request to `h5upload.php` file.

Finally, `image-upload-resized.php` show example to resize images from client before upload to `uploadResized.php`. It's very helpful to make sure your member will not upload unwanted file size to your server.

The resizing process uses Phil Brown `ImageManipulator` class.
